## Description
Our Idea is Decentralised Crowd Funding Platform with Integrated Polling and Feeds System for our Application. Let us Suppoe the Case, When You want to donate a certain amount for a Cause (let us Suppose Covid-19), In this Particular Case, An Observation was made into the accounting and creditability for Donation through  particular channel which aims to provide Services for the Cause. In Case of Our Country It was observed that no Accounatbility was given by  PM Cares Funds, Which aimed to solve the issue as a mediator for the services being offered and considered as a takeaway from the users. In this particular case, there was no information regarding creditability and the utilization of the funds for various causes related to COVID-19. This paved the idea solution for our project.

Our Idea aims to decentralise the process of crowdfunding by using blockchain and its fundamentals such as smart contracts. Our application will serve on the networks of different blocks being mined for the enrouting of the funds directly to the service provider. As such in this particular case, we will get the information of the various venders the government is dealing with and directly transfer funds maintaining a log in a decentralised network such as Ethereum. As such, with respect to innumerable vendors and to the  allocation of funds, a poll list will be actively monitoring for the trends and needs towards the cause. The users are required to link their Aadhar Card, their application to maintain authenticity. The application provides feeds about the transaction to all the users in the network making realise the sensational transference for the cause and novelity towards the socieity
